# 3d-Renderer-V1
Uses 3rd person rendering technique to render 3d verticies, lines, and objects.

Note:
Prespective does not currently work properly due to the ineffective algorithm.
I will be changing to 1st person rendering (projection rendering) soon and if you know how to fix the perspective please tell me.
Anyone can modify this project and share it around, just don't claim that you made it completly your self.
I have not add an obj reader yet but might soon

Function:
Render 3d objects (vertecies and lines)
ortho + "perspective"
3rd person rendering technique

  Open windows DOS (Assumming on windows)

  test java by typing "java"
  if it works, type "java GameMain"
